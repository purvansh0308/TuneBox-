# 🎵 TuneBox

**TuneBox** is a modern and responsive music player interface that mimics Spotify's sleek design using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to play songs stored locally on their device with real-time controls such as play/pause, volume adjustment, progress tracking, and song duration — all powered by the native `Audio` Web API.
